	<h1> What Does It Mean to Be a Leader</h1> 
			<p> When you think of the world's greatest leaders who do you think of? 
				You probably think of the classic leaders that would succeed in any realm they enter. 
				People like Steve Jobs, FDR, Abraham Lincoln, Kobe Bryant etc, etc. 
				What do all these people have in common? They all drew people in based on 
				their ideas, abilities, and actions.
				All of these people were extremely different, but they all had one similar
				attribute: they had the ability to draw people in.
				All of these great leaders all had their share of deficieces, and all of them
				had their share of controversies. So the question begs to differ: who is the greatest
				leader this world has ever seen? There are millions of people who claim to be great leaders
				Historically there are hundreds of thousands of men and women people followed to their death. 
				I'd like to argue that there is only one leader who is impacting the world thousands of years 
				after his death and will persist to do so until the end of time. His name?

				The rabi with a small group of followers, who was killed and mocked
				is expected to have over 2.9 billion followers by 2050 according to 
				
				<a href="http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/religions/christians">Global Religious Futures </a> 
				
				What does this mean? Well I'd argue that the only way for a group of people that
				exist, who live from America to China, and be united under one belief is to have
				one central leader who teaches and corrects through the bible. There is otherwise, 
				no conceivable way for a group this large, the largest religious group in the world, could exist. 
				As we see on the map shown below, it's clear that a large percentage of people in almost every 
				continent are Christians. Think about the long lasting impact that comes from a man who was said 
				to be born almost two thousand years ago. He left an indelible impression on this earth even after he died
				over two thousand years ago. Today, men and women both exclaim and exalt a deity that they themselves have 
				never encountered in person. The only way I know this to be possible is for there to be one central person with
				the qualities of a leader that every human thirsts for. So, we recognize that Jesus has had an impact on this
				earth that we can hardly fathom. Well then where do we go from here? Do we merely twiddle our thumbs and accept it
				No. Next, we need to dive into his characteristics that entraces nations.

					The following are some of Jesus' core characteristics that anyone today can possess
				</p>		
				<ul>
								<li>Wisdom</li>
								<li>integrity</li>
								<li>trust in others</li>
								<li>teacher</li>
								<li>courage</li> 
								<li>humility</li> 
								<li>originality</li> 
								<li>compassion</li>
							</ul>
				
				<p>	
					Naturally, these aren't the only characteristics one can see in man, and these aren't 
					the only things we see in Jesus, however one could make the argument that when looking
					for a leader these are key components people look for. Let's observe different leader's 
					and match them up to these components based on public perception and through readings.

					As you can see in three examples we see that you'll find a hard time finding anyone let alone a leader
					who shares in all these attributes. Naturally, to believe in this we trust in one of the only we sources we have, 
					which happens to be the bible that cites these experiences as first hand. Even the United States of America's great
					president lacks the majority of leadership qualities, though this can change depending on the person. 
					The basis of this entire article is built on the bible, which is the book that every Christian follows
					No where within the bible will you read "How to be a leader", however, when you read in between the
					lines, you will find that it's quite clear how the bible spells out leadership. It is quite simply, Love.
					According to the bible love is much more than just a lovey dovey feeling our culture has associated with
					the word. It has more to do than chocolates and flowers.

						<blockquote cite="http://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/13.htm">
							If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do 
							not have love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does no dishonor others
							it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no records of wrongs. Love does not delight in eveil but rejoices with the 
							truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres...For now we see only a reflection 
							as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then i shall know fully, even as I am fully known
							And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love. 
						</blockquote> 
				<p> 
					When I say that love is the most important attribute in a leader I say it because all the attributes that the bible gives love above are invaluable
					attributes that have the ability to affect most people. Jesus is the epitome of love. He is by all means the definition of the word itself. Every story in the bible about 
					Jesus displays an attribute of love and holds it up and compares it to Jesus. Jesus wasn't the kind of love that we see today. He's the love that shows hard truths. He calls
					people out based on the wrong that they're doing, but he does so without condemming them. He builds others up to become leaders. He has compassion for the weak and meek. He sharpens
					other men as iron sharpens iron. Jesus does it without discrimination. Anyone and everyone is deserving of such love.
